## ACM Ethics Code
### Ethical Issues
Ethical issues that could occur with YO include but are not limited to:  
* The YO application has the ability to connect your profile to your Facebook account. In doing so, the app has the ability to find more personal information than what is actually required. The process of connecting your YO account to your Facebook account can lead to some private information being attained by the YO company. In order to stop this from happening, the YO application will also accept just creating an account on the app instead of conneting it to a Facebook account, giving the user more privacy.
* Another ethical issue that could arise is honesty. The YO company could make false claims, or just claims that have no evidence to support it. For example, the YO company could say "buy our app! It'll put you face to face with friends faster!" The problem with this statement is that the application is in no way connected to making a friend get around quicker, nor does it have anyway to solve the problem of traffic. In order to avoid this, the company will make statements that can be backed up with data or they will not speak on the subject.
* The YO app could be only available for iPhone users, which would mean that only people who use apple products would be able to use the YO app. This act would be called discrimination against android users, since the application is not readily available for all phone users.
### Legal Issues
Legal issues can be very troublesome, since you have to account for all locations that the app will be available in. Here are a few legal issues:
* Say the company is not doing well, so in order to make more money the company decided to sell the phone numbers of its users to a company that harasses people everyday by calling and offering them new insurance. The legal issue here is that the YO company has now given out confidential information, which would most likely move to a very heavy lawsuit against the company.
* The YO app has just released a new update, where now users can send a "YO" out onto Twitter. The problem is the company did not ask permission to do this with Twitter. So the company is using Twitter's trademark without their knowledge to increase the amount of flow on their applicaiton. This would be an illegal use of trademark!
* In Japan, the privacy laws are just a bit different than they are in the United States. Within Japan, a company must abide by the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) if they are storing data of 5,000 or more people. Say the YO company has released the app in Japan, but in order to not have to abide by their laws the company decided to botch the number of people using their application. They tell the government that they have less than 5,000 users and will not have to abide by the APPI. This would definitely find itself to a courtroom as this is postively against the laws of Japan.
