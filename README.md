## ACM Ethics Code
### Ethical Issues
Ethical issues that could happen with YO include but are not limited to:  
* The YO application has the ability to connect your profile to your Facebook account. In doing so, the app has the ability to find more personal information than what is actually required. The process of connecting your YO account to your Facebook account can lead to some private information being attained by the YO company. In order to stop this from happening, the YO application will also accept just creating an account on the app instead of conneting it to a Facebook account, giving the user more privacy.
* Another ethical issue that could arise is honesty. The YO company could make false claims, or just claims that have no evidence to support it. For example, the YO company could say "buy our app! It'll put you face to face with friends faster!" The problem with this statement is that the application is in no way connected to making a friend get around quicker, nor does it have anyway to solve the problem of traffic. In order to avoid this, the company will make statements that can be backed up with data or they will not speak on the subject.
